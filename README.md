## Summary

I've been learning a lot since I started the Software Development Mastermind program, but this application was a huge step up in developing logic and acquiring a higher understanding of DOM manipulation with classes, creating multiple condition statements, and working in mathmatical functions. This was a very challenging project, but it really leveled up my ability to expand a deeper understanding of programming.
